# Image-processing

## Installing python: 
**Linux**: Already has python. If want a different version use the following command: `sudo apt install python<version>`
  
**MAC & Windows**: Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/ and download the setup. Run the setup and python will be installed

To work with python, an ide is preferable. Following are some good ide:
1. Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
2. VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Atom: https://atom.io/
4. PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
5. Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

Any other ide is also fine. You can use python online too for e.g. on google colab.

## Installing OpenCV:
The easiest way to install opencv is to use pip. After installing python, use following command: `pip install opencv-python`

Again, you can use online plateforms for using opencv. It works fine on Google Colab with a bit of modifications.


## Working with Python
Here are some good resources to get yourself familiarized with Python:
1. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ (For whoever reads the docs)
2. From the basics: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial
3. If the above is too low level, https://www.learnpython.org/
4. The one with good internet packages and like videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh
5. Concise Guide: https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Python
6. For book readers, https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
