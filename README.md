# Image-processing

Installing python: 
Linux: Already has python. If want a different version use the following command: sudo apt install python<version>
MAC & Windows: Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/ and download the setup. Run the setup and python will be installed

To work with python, an ide is preferable. Following are some good ide:
1. Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
2. VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Atom: https://atom.io/
4. PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
5. Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

Any other ide is also fine. You can use python online too for e.g. on google colab.


Installing OpenCV:
The easiest way to install opencv is to use pip. After installing python, use following command: pip install opencv-python

Again, you can use online plateforms for using opencv. It works fine on Google Colab with a bit of modifications.
